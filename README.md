## About
This applescript is heavily addapted from [various](http://peterdowns.com/posts/open-iterm-finder-service.html) [locations](https://gist.github.com/uguryavas/6b409f6058cca2e2412f). Instead of using automator, however, this version is pure applescript, going from 2.5MB to 916KB.

    git clone https://github.com/thekelvinliu/Open-in-iTerm.git
Go into the folder, and command-drag the app into finder's toolbar!

## Usage
Simply use finder as you normally would. Just click the iTerm icon in the toolbar to quickly open the current directory in iTerm!
